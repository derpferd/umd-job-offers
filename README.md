### What is this?
This is literally just a spreadsheet containing job offers received by UMD CS students. This is meant to help students in job search so that they don't blindly accept the first offer they get.

1. Click on the file you want to add data to (internship.csv or full-time.csv).
2. In the top right corner of the file viewer, click the pencil icon to edit the file.
3. Insert your data according to "Start year" with pay as the tie-breaker.
4. Scroll down to commit changes.
5. Push to master and done!
